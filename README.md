# DDoS_Attack_Detection

The detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks is paramount in
safeguarding network infrastructures against malicious disruptions. This research
underscores the critical importance of robust DDoS attack detection systems. It
introduces a pioneering contribution in the form of a carefully curated dataset designed to address challenges associated with imbalanced class distributions, thereby
enhancing the realism of cyber threat representation. The proposed dataset serves
as a foundation for evaluating three distinct deep learning models—Artificial Neural
Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM.
In navigating the intricacies of imbalanced datasets, our models showcase remarkable adaptability, exhibiting high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score values.
Furthermore, the study extends its analysis to a balanced dataset, mirroring realworld cybersecurity scenarios. The equalized representation of normal and DDoS
attack instances in our dataset contributes to the models’ consistent and robust performance. This research illuminates the significance of dataset design in fortifying
the reliability of deep learning models for DDoS attack detection, reaffirming their
practical applicability in cybersecurity.
